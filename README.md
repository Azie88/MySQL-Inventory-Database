MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for managing and storing data. It is known for its reliability, speed, and ease of use. MySQL has also become the database of choice for many of the most successful open source applications, including WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and Magento.

SQL is the most common standardized language used to access databases.
